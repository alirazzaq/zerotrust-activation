## Overview

ZeroTrust Activation (ZTA) is a novel generic and robust activation function for neural networks, inspired by the "Zero Trust" paradigm in cybersecurity. It combines a learnable sigmoid ("trust verification") and tanh ("boundary enforcement") gate:

\[
\text{ZTA}(x;\alpha, \beta) = x \cdot \sigma(\alpha x) \cdot \tanh(\beta x)
\]

- **Learnable parameters:** $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are trust-levels optimized by backpropagation.
- **Compatible** with CNNs, ViTs, MLPs, and more.
- **Outperforms** ReLU, GELU, Mish, Swish on accuracy, robustness, and gradient flow.
- **Built for reproducible research and real deployment.**

> This repo contains code, PyTorch modules, training scripts, and evaluation tools to reproduce the results from the paper.
